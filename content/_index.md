    subheading: You need your cyber defense to stay sharp. That's why we push the limits of "adapt and respond." We don't sell or underpin any of our services with proprietary licenses. Each foundational service works together or apart. We can design, build, and run a world-class cybersecurity maintenance program for you.
    cards:
    - heading: CYBERSOC
      text: Our flagship service can collect, monitor, sample, and dissect your machine generated data; from the cloud to OT/IOT.
